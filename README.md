# questFON Call-Tracking by Telequest

The system merges the online statistics data with the call data. 
The calls can therefore be attributed to individual users.

## How it functions
- For each user who visits your website, an individual (slightly modified) call number is indicated.
- The incoming call on the indicated call number is registered by the call tracking server.  All important information is forwarded by the server to your online statistics.
- The online statistics allocates the call of the individual session and shows you the most important data such as time, source, duration etc. gathered in Google Analytics and at a glance.
