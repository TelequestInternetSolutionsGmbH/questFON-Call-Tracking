# questFON Call-Tracking by Telequest

## What is Call Tracking?
Call tracking offers the possibility to precisely trace through which channels calls were generated and therefore is able to measure several types of advertising campaigns. Telephone number can be assigned to different advertisements online and offline (content, direct mail, etc.). The call data generated can be integrated via the Call Tracking server into proven analysis tools such as Google Analytics, CRM systems, etc. Suitable phone numbers (as FreeCall or geographic numbers) can be directly provided by questFON.

## How does Call Tracking work?
The dynamic call tracking displays individual telephone numbers on the website and links the respective number to the website user. The display of the individual numbers is fully automatic. Various ways of displaying the numbers are available. All gathered call data is stored in the form of reports in one or more Google Analytics accounts. Furthermore, the data allows individual reports to be compiled in the Google Data Studio.

1. For each user on your website an individual (slightly modified)  telephone number is indicated and displayed.
1. The incoming call via indicated number is registered by the call tracking server. All valuable information is forwarded by the server to your online statistics.
1. The online statistics allocate the call of the individual session and shows the most important data as time, source, duration, keyword etc. gathered in f.e. Google Analytics.

## How can Call Tracking be implemented?
The implementation of Call Tracking can be easily done via Google Tag-Manager. A detailed guide is provided online at: https://www.questfon.cloud/call-tracking/integration/
